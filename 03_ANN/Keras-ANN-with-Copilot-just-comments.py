# solving mnist with tensorflow keras and a dense layer

# import all the required libraries

# load the data

# output the shape of the data (also was is drinnen in den datens√§tzen)

# output the dimension of the data

# output the size of the data

# output the dimension of the labels

# output the dimension of the images

# normalize the data

# reshape the data

# do a one hot encoding of the labels

# create a sequential model with a dense hidden layer with 512 neurons

# create a dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation

# make a summary of the model

# compile the model

# train the model and keep track of the loss and accuracy

# render the loss and validation loss

# render the accuracy and validation accuracy

# evaluate the model using the test data and print the accuracy

# show the first image in the test data

# plott the first image in the test data with the predicted label
